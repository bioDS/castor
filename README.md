This is a forked version of castor 1.7.11 so that sampled ancestor trees can be produced. Note that further work is necessary to make deterministic density calculations suitable for sampled ancestor trees.

This repository is used to produce nLTT curves for "The Fossilised Birth-Death Model is Identifiable" (code available at [FBD-dLTTs](https://github.com/bioDS/FBD-dLTTs)).
